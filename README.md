### Project Title: A WO(MAN) TURNING INTO A DOT
A WO(MAN) TURNING INTO A DOT is a self-discovery experience through a journey across dimensions. It is an interactive short film made with Tik Tok effect house.

1. <b>Project Concept:</b> <br />
If we think about Tik Tok as a *cultural product*, it transforms us into others and teleports us to different places through virtual space. Drawing from this characteristic of Tik Tok as a medium, we created a story about growth, self-reflection, and the meaning of life using the representation of the journey of a dot traveling across different dimensions. 
We engage the audience through thinking, empathizing, and reflecting, thereby emphasizing a sense of presence, of being here.

1. <b>Inspiration:</b> <br />
Our story is inspired by two books of fictions, [Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott, in which the author uses geometry to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture and [A Man Becomes A Stick](https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/man-who-turned-stick#:~:text=In%20Abe's%20metaphor%2C%20the%20rigidity,of%20their%20%E2%80%9Cfake%20dreams.%E2%80%9D) by the Japanese novelist Abe Kōbō. Kōbō took the ordinary object of a stick, personified it, and asked the reader: “What is the meaning of life?” Through these different inspirations, we decided to create a story about self-discovery.

1. <b>Content:</b> <br />
We trace the journey of a character traveling across dimensions and experiencing self-discovery.<br />
The audience/user will transform into a dot, to a line, to a plane, to a sphere, and pursue difficult questions in life: *Where am I? Who am I? What do I want to be?*<br />
Combining animations and poetic sketches, we piece together the narrative in the format of a letter - a conversation with ourselves - and a self-reflective space we’d like to share with our audience.

1. <b>Process:</b> <br />
We created the story in three steps. First, we had a brief storyboard sketch. Based on the storyline, we thought about how we can add Tik Tok filters in storytelling, and decided where the filters should appear. Second, we thought about the contents of the filter, which is we used mainly as transitions between dimensions in our story. Third, we made the story more solid by adding narratives and interesting visuals. <br />
<b>Tools</b> that we used to create this interactive short film include: Effect house, Maya, CapCut, Figma, Adobe ps, ai, pr, au, Substance Painter, etc.
