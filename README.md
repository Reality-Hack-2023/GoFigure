### Team Go Figure
### Project Title: A WO(MAN) TURNING INTO A DOT

1. <b>Project Concept:</b> <br />
If we think about Tik Tok as a *cultural product*, it transforms us into others and teleports us to different places through virtual space. Drawing from this characteristic of Tik Tok as a medium, we created a story about growth, self-reflection, and the meaning of life using the representation of the journey of a dot traveling across different dimensions. 
We engage the audience through thinking, empathizing, and reflecting, thereby emphasizing a sense of presence, of being here.
