### Project Title: A WO(MAN) TURNING INTO A DOT
A WO(MAN) TURNING INTO A DOT is a self-discovery experience through a journey across dimensions. It is an interactive short film made with Tik Tok effects.

1. <b>Project Concept:</b> <br />
If we think about Tik Tok as a *cultural product*, it transforms us into others and teleports us to different places through virtual space. Drawing from this characteristic of Tik Tok as a medium, we created a story about growth, self-reflection, and the meaning of life using the representation of the journey of a dot traveling across different dimensions. 
We engage the audience through thinking, empathizing, and reflecting, thereby emphasizing a sense of presence, of being here.

1. <b>Inspiration:</b> <br />
Our story is inspired by two books of fictions, [Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott, in which the author uses geometry to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture and [A Man Becomes A Stick](https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/man-who-turned-stick#:~:text=In%20Abe's%20metaphor%2C%20the%20rigidity,of%20their%20%E2%80%9Cfake%20dreams.%E2%80%9D) by the Japanese novelist Abe Kōbō. Kōbō took the ordinary object of a stick, personified it, and asked the reader: “What is the meaning of life?” Through these different inspirations, we decided to create a story about self-discovery.
